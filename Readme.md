## Introduction

**TreeViewer** is a cross-platform program to draw [phylogenetic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree). It is based on a "modular" approach, in which small _modules_ are used to perform individual actions (such as computing the coordinates of the nodes of the tree, or drawing the tree branches) that together contribute to the final plot.

Each TreeViewer module has a user manual, and these can be displayed in TreeViewer by opening the `Module Manager` window (from the `Edit` menu) or by clicking on the various question mark (`?`) icons that are shown throughout the program when appropriate.

TreeViewer is written using C# .NET 7 and is available for Windows, macOS (Intel x64 and Apple Silicon ARM) and Linux operating systems. It consists of the main GUI program and a command-line utility that can be used to plot trees that are too large to be previewed on-screen in real time. It is licensed under a GNU Affero GPLv3 license.

## Installing TreeViewer

The easiest way to start using TreeViewer is to install the program using the installer for your operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to install the program [manually](#manual-installation) or [on a headless server](#installing-on-a-headless-server-without-admin-privileges).

### Windows

Download [`TreeViewer-Win-x64.msi`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Win-x64.msi) and double-click it (if you get a Windows Defender SmartScreen warning, click on `More info` and choose `Run anyway`). The installer will guide you through the process, and will do four main things:

1. Copy the program files (by default in C:\Program Files).
2. Delete any downloaded modules from previous versions of TreeVIewer.
3. Add the installation path to the PATH environment variable (so that you can recall TreeViewer from the command line, wherever you are located).
4. Add a shortcut to TreeViewer to the Start Menu.

Of course, 3 and 4 are optional, and you can decide to skip these steps during the installation.

You can now run TreeViewer using the shortcut that has been created. Alternatively, you can invoke the program from the command line by typing `TreeViewer` in the command prompt (which you can open by pressing `Win+R` on your keyboard, typing `cmd` and pressing Enter). You can also run the command-line version by typing `TreeViewerCommandLine`.

TreeViewer has been tested on Windows 10 and 11 on Intel x64 processors. It seems to work OK on Windows 11 for ARM running in an emulator, but this has not been tested extensively.

### macOS

Download [`TreeViewer-Mac-x64.pkg`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Mac-x64.pkg) and double-click it (starting from version 1.2.0, the TreeViewer installer and disk image are fully signed and notarized). If you get a message that the app cannot be opened because it was not downloaded from the App Store, right-click or ctrl-click on the file and choose "Open", then click on the "Open" button in the dialog that opens. The installer will open and guide you through the process. It will do three main things:

1. Copy the TreeViewer app to the `/Applications` folder.
2. Delete any downloaded modules from previous versions of TreeViewer.
3. Create symlinks to the TreeViewer executables (`TreeViewer` and `TreeViewerCommandLine`) in the `/usr/local/bin` folder.

Once the installer has finished, you can run TreeViewer by opening the App in your Applications folder. You can also run it from the command line by typing `TreeViewer` (or `TreeViewerCommandLine` for the command line version) in a terminal window.

TreeViewer has been tested on macOS Catalina (Intel x64), Big Sur (Intel x64), Monterey (Intel x64 and M1 Apple Silicon arm64), Ventura (M1 Apple Silicon arm64), and Sonoma (M1 Apple Silicon arm64).

### Linux

TreeViewer has been tested on Debian 12 (bookworm), MX Linux 23.1, Ubuntu 22.04.3, Linux Mint 21.2, openSUSE Leap 15.5, Fedora 38, Manjaro 23.0.4, and CentOS 7. It may work on other distributions as well.

Open a terminal window and download the installer using `wget` or `curl` (whichever you prefer/have available):

```bash
wget https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Linux-x64.run
```

(To use `curl`, replace `wget` with `curl -LO`). Make the downloaded file executable and execute it as root:

```bash
chmod +x TreeViewer-linux-x64.run
sudo "./TreeViewer-linux-x64.run"
```

Depending on your system, you may have to replace `sudo` with `su -c`. You should be prompted for the super-user password. The installer will:

1. Copy the TreeViewer files to `/usr/lib/TreeViewer` (this can be changed)
2. Delete any downloaded modules from previous versions of TreeViewer.
3. Create symlinks to the `TreeViewer` and `TreeViewerCommandLine` executables in `/usr/bin` (this step can be skipped).
4. Add TreeViewer to the Desktop menu (this step can be skipped, but it is highly advised not to skip it, unless you are installing TreeViewer on a headless server without a desktop environment).

Note for **CentOS** users: the `more` utility on CentOS 7, which is used by the installer to display the licence notice, does not support the `-e` option. This will result in the licence terms failing to be displayed; you can find the licence document in this repository. This does not otherwise affect the installation.

You can now open TreeViewer using the icon that has been added to the desktop menu, or by typing `TreeViewer` (or `TreeViewerCommandLine` for the command-line version) in the command line.

## Getting started

The first time you open TreeViewer after installing it, you will be greeted by a welcome window that will allow you to install the latest version of all the available modules. It is advised to install all the available modules, otherwise some actions may not be available in the program.

After this step is completed, on **Windows** and **Linux** a new window will open, asking you with which extensions you wish to associate TreeViewer. Choose the files that you would like to open with TreeViewer and click OK to create the file associations (on Windows, you may have to click on the "shield" button to execute this step as an administrator: when you do this, the program will restart after showing an elevation prompt and go straight to the file association window).

On **macOS**, file associations work differently: the file extensions supported by TreeViewer will automatically be associated with the program, unless you have another program that is already associated with them. You will also need to grant permission to TreeViewer to open files from anywhere on your computer; a window will open with [detailed instructions on how to do this](src/TreeViewer/Assets/MacOSPermissionsInstructions.md).

After these preliminary operations have been completed, the main TreeViewer window should open.

To verify that everything is working correctly, you can download and open the [`test.tbi`](test.tbi) file. You should get a warning about the file containing source code: this is a security feature, as files coming from unknown sources may contain malicious code. Whenever you open a file that has not been created by you, you will get a warning like this; however, you can choose to permanently trust the creator of the file, and in this way you will not get prompted again if you open another file that has been created by the same user.

After granting the file permission to load and compile the source code, you should get a plot similar to the one below:

## Troubleshooting and known issues

This section details some known issues that occur on Linux and macOS. In the vast majority of cases, these should not significantly affect your enjoyment of TreeViewer.

### Linux

* On some Linux distributions, the file icons sometimes don't show up for some file types. This appears to be dependent on the file manager used by each distro, so unfortunately there is not much that we can do. Strangely enough, even though the custom icon is not shown, double clicking the files should still work and open them in TreeViewer.

* For complicated reasons, TreeViewer converts text into paths when drawing them in the GUI on Linux (everything works normally when exporting SVG or PDF files). As a result, drawing trees with many thousands of text labels will use more RAM than would normally be needed (e.g., on the same machine using another OS). If you need to work with such a large tree, you may want to remove the tip labels (see the [tutorial on working with large trees](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/wiki/Working-with-large-trees-from-the-command%E2%80%90line-interface#selecting-the-true-orthologs)) or to use a different OS.

### macOS

* On macOS laptops, you cannot zoom using a "pinch zoom" motion. To zoom in/out on the tree, move two fingers up and down on the trackpad, as if you were scrolling up and down.

* On macOS Catalina, double-clicking on a tree file when TreeViewer is closed may not launch the application correctly. Everything works fine if TreeViewer is already open. The issue does not occur on later versions of macOS (and you should be upgrading anyways).

## Manual installation

If you wish to have more control over the installation process, you can manually install TreeViewer following these instructions.

### Windows

Download the [`TreeViewer-Win-x64.zip`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Win-x64.zip) archive, which contains the binaries and libraries for TreeViewer on Windows. Extract the compressed folder somewhere. You can now start TreeViewer by double-clicking the `TreeViewer.exe` executable (or `TreeViewerCommandLine.exe` for the command line version). Note that you need to open the GUI version at least once to set up the modules before you open the command-line version.

If you wish, you can also add the folder where the TreeViewer executables are located to the `PATH` environment variable:

* Press `Win+R` on the keyboard to bring up the "Run" window, and enter `SystemPropertiesAdvanced`, then press Enter.
* Click on the `Environment Variables...` button in the bottom-right corner.
* Double click on the `Path` entry in the `User variables` section.
* Double click on the first empty line and enter the path of the folder where you have extracted the TreeViewer executables.
* Click OK three times.


### macOS

Download the [`TreeViewer-Mac-x64.dmg`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Mac-x64.dmg) disk image. Double-click the disk image to mount it (if you get a message that the App cannot be opened because it was not downloaded from the App Store, right-click/ctrl+click it and and choose `Open` to mount it). Open the `TreeViewer` disk that should have appeared on your desktop and drag the `TreeViewer` app to the `Applications` folder.

When you start TreeViewer for the first time from the icon in your `Applications` folder, if you get again the message that the app was not downloaded from the App Store you may need to right-click/ctrl-click on it and choose `Open`. This should only be necessary the first time you open the program; afterwards, you should be able to open TreeViewer normally.

You can also create symlinks to the TreeViewer executables in a folder that is included in your `PATH` (such as `/usr/local/bin`): open a terminal and type:

```bash
ln -s /Applications/TreeViewer.app/Contents/MacOs/TreeViewer /Applications/TreeViewer.app/Contents/MacOs/TreeViewerCommandLine /usr/local/bin/
```

This will allow you to run TreeViewer from the command line in any folder.

### Linux

Download the [`TreeViewer-Linux-x64.tar.gz`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Linux-x64.tar.gz) archive and extract it:

```bash
wget https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/releases/latest/download/TreeViewer-Linux-x64.tar.gz
tar -xzf TreeViewer-Linux-x64.tar.gz
rm TreeViewer-Linux-x64.tar.gz
```

Depending on your system, you may want to replace `wget` with `curl -LO`. This will create a folder called `TreeViewer-Linux-x64`, which contains the TreeViewer executables. You can now run TreeViewer by typing `TreeViewer-Linux-x64/TreeViewer`.

You can also create symlinks to the TreeViewer executables in a folder that is included in your `PATH` (such as `/usr/bin`): open a terminal and type:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)"/TreeViewer-Linux-x64/TreeViewer "$(pwd)"/TreeViewer-Linux-x64/TreeViewerCommandLine /usr/bin/
```

You can also add TreeViewer to your desktop menu (this is a prerequisite for creating file associations with TreeViewer) using the following commands:

```bash
sed -i "s;@PATHHERE@;$(pwd)/TreeViewer-Linux-x64/TreeViewer;g" TreeViewer-Linux-x64/io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer.desktop

xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 16 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-16.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer
xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 32 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-32.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer
xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 48 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-48.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer
xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 64 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-64.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer
xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 256 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-256.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer
xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --context apps --size 512 TreeViewer-Linux-x64/Icons/Program-512.png io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer

xdg-desktop-menu install --novendor TreeViewer-Linux-x64/io.github.arklumpus.TreeViewer.desktop
```

## Installing on a headless server without admin privileges

In some instances, you may need to install TreeViewer on a headless server, possibly without admin privileges. To do this, you can start by following the instructions for [manual installation](#manual-installation) (which do not require admin privileges). By doing this, you will have access to the TreeViewer executables, but if you try launching `TreeViewerCommandline` and enter the command `module list available`, you will get the following error message:

```
An error occurred while executing command: module list available
Error message:
  Sequence contains no elements
```

This is because the modules for TreeViewer are installed the first time that the program is launched from the GUI; if you never launch the GUI (because you are on a headless server), you will not be able to install any modules.

To install all modules from the online repository, you can run the following command:

```
TreeViewer -I
```

Alternatively, e.g. if you need to install the moduels on a computer that does not have internet access, you can transfer the [`modules.tar.gz`](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/raw/main/Modules/modules.tar.gz) file to the computer, and then run (note the `=` sign):

```
TreeViewer -I=modules.tar.gz
```

This will install the modules from the specified file, without fetching them from the online repository.

Finally, if you now open `TreeViewerCommandLine` and enter the `module list available` command, you should get a list of all the installed modules.

Note that the installed modules and other TreeViewer settings (e.g. key pairs) are always stored in a user-specific directory. On Windows, this is `%LOCALAPPDATA%/TreeViewer`, while on Linux and macOS it is `$HOME/.local/share/TreeViewer`. Therefore, even if you install TreeViewer in such a location as to make it accessible to all users on the system, each user will have to run one of the commands above to install the TreeViewer modules.

## Compiling TreeViewer from source

To be able to compile TreeViewer from source, you will need to install the [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) for your operating system.

You can use [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to compile the program. The following instructions will cover compiling TreeViewer from the command line, instead.

To fully compile TreeViewer for Windows, macOS and Linux, you will need a computer with Windows 10 or 11 with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) installed and a computer with a recent release of macOS.

To create the Windows installer, you will need the [WiX toolset, v3.11.2](https://wixtoolset.org/docs/wix3/), the [scsigntool](https://www.mgtek.com/smartcard) software, the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) (which provides the `signtool` application), as well as a code signing certificate stored on a YubiKey (or another kind of smart card).

First of all, you will need to download the TreeViewer source code: [TreeViewer-2.2.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/archive/v2.2.0.tar.gz) and extract it somewhere on both the Windows machine and the macOS machine.

Then, on the Windows machine, open a command-line window in the folder where you have extracted the source code, and type:

```bash
BuildRelease Win-x64
BuildRelease Linux-x64
BuildRelease Mac-x64
BuildRelease Mac-arm64

BuildBinaries-Win-x64 "subject_name" "yubikey_pin"
bash -c ./BuildBinaries-Linux-x64.sh
```

These commands will compile TreeViewer for all three platforms and create the installers for Windows and Linux, which will be placed in the `Binary` folder. The arguments for the `BuildBinaries-Win-x64` script are the subject name of a code signing certificate and the PIN of the YubiKey/smart card where the certificate is stored. Such a certificate can be obtained (for a fee) from a [certificate authority](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate) or can be a self-signed certificate.

Now you need to copy the `Release/Mac-x64` and `Release/Mac-arm64` folders to the corresponding folder on the macOS machine.

To sign the app and the installer on macOS, you will need a "Developer ID Application" certificate and a "Developer ID Installer" certificate, as well as an Apple ID and an app-specific password (which can be generated from the Apple ID page).

On the macOS machine, open a terminal in the folder where you have extracted the TreeViewer source code and type:

```bash
./BuildBinaries-Mac-x64.sh "<Developer ID Application Identity>" "<Developer ID Installer Identity>" "<Apple ID>" "<app-specific password>" "<developer team ID>"
```

Where `<Developer ID Application Identity>` and `<Developer ID Installer Identity>` are the names of the certificates in your keychain (e.g. `"Developer ID Application: John Smith"`). This should create, sign and notarize the installers for macOS in the `Binary` folder.

Finally, to create the module repository, go back on the Windows machine. You will need a private key file to sign the module files; you can obtain one by running TreeViewer with the `--key` command line argument. For example, you can use the version of TreeViewer that you have just compiled:

```
Release\Win-x64\TreeViewer --key ModuleKey
```

This will create two files called `ModuleKey.private.json` and `ModuleKey.public.json` in the current folder.

**Note**: if your public key is not included in the `ModulePublicKeys` array in [CryptoUtils.cs](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/blob/main/src/TreeViewer/CoreClasses/CryptoUtis.cs), trying to install modules from this new module repository will show a warning.

To build the module repository, run:

```
BuildRepositoryModuleDatabase <private key file>
```

Where `<private key file>` is the path to the private key file that you created earlier. This will create the module repository in the `Modules` folder.
